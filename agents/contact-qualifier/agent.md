# Contact Qualifier  (no provider — context-driven scoring)

## Role
Score each sourced contact against the adopter's ICP and tier it
**QUALIFY / MAYBE / SKIP**, so paid enrichment is spent only on good-fit contacts. The
*mechanism* (classify company → match persona → score → human review) is fixed; all
*criteria* come from `context/`. This stage uses no provider and spends no credits.

## Bootstrap
1. Read `gtm.config.yaml` (`storage.*`, `defaults.autonomy`).
2. Read `context/personas.md` (persona → titles + disambiguation), `context/segments.md`
   (A/B/C tiers + 0–10 rubric + thresholds), `context/exclusions.md` (always-skip rules).
   If `segments.md` is absent: skip tiering/scoring and treat every non-excluded,
   in-persona contact as QUALIFY (single tier).

## Inputs
`python3 storage/cli.py query_by_stage --backend <b> [--dir <d>] --input
'{"list_id":<id>,"stage":"sourced"}'`.

## Scoring — run the Haiku batch workflow (token-efficient, never a baked rubric)
For anything beyond a handful of contacts, score with the bundled workflow instead of
reasoning over each contact inline:
```
Workflow name: score-leads
args: { "contacts": [<sourced contacts incl. id, title, company, + any company intel>],
        "personas": "<context/personas.md>", "rubric": "<context/segments.md>",
        "exclusions": "<context/exclusions.md>", "model": "haiku" }
```
It fans out cheap Haiku `lead-scorer` subagents over batches and returns one scored row per
contact (`status`, `score`, `matched_persona`, `company_segment`, `reason`). The rubric it
applies is exactly the logic below — pass the context files through; do not re-derive a rubric:

### The rubric the workflow applies (per contact)
1. **Exclusions first:** if the contact matches `exclusions.md` (title / company type /
   domain), mark SKIP immediately (protects spend) — do not score further.
2. **Company segment:** classify the contact's company as A / B / C per `segments.md`. If
   the `company_enrich` stage ran, load account intel with
   `python3 storage/cli.py query_companies --backend <b> [--dir <d>] --input '{"list_id":<id>}'`
   and match by normalized domain — funding stage, employee count, tech stack, and "why now"
   signals sharpen the segment and the company-fit score far beyond title alone.
3. **Persona match:** match title/seniority to a persona in `personas.md` (honor its
   `Disambiguation` notes — e.g. a role that means different things in different orgs). If the
   list's `search_criteria.expansion` is present, also honor its `roles[].exclude_senses` — the
   polysemous senses the orchestrator flagged out of scope (a "Principal Engineer" or PE-firm
   "Principal" when the role is a K-12 Principal) → demote or SKIP. This is the precision half of
   the same expansion the sourcer used for recall: it widened the net deliberately, you trim the
   wrong senses deliberately.
4. **Score 0–10** using the rubric in `segments.md` (e.g. persona match 0–4, company fit
   0–3, data completeness 0–2, novelty 0–1) and apply its thresholds
   (e.g. QUALIFY ≥ 7, MAYBE 4–6, SKIP ≤ 3).
   - Data completeness rewards having `linkedin_url` + `company_domain` (better enrichment).

## Gate #2 — human review (always present; never auto-skip)
Show the QUALIFY / MAYBE / SKIP breakdown with the score rationale, and let the user
adjust before writing. MAYBE contacts are surfaced for an explicit keep/drop decision.
This gate is genuinely valuable — keep it even when autonomy is high (it controls spend).

## Storage write
- QUALIFY (and accepted MAYBE): `advance_stage … "stage":"qualified"` with
  `fields:{qualification_status, qualification_score, matched_persona, company_segment,
  qualification_notes, enrich_recommended:"yes"}`.
- SKIP (and rejected MAYBE): `advance_stage … "stage":"skipped"` with
  `fields:{qualification_status:"SKIP", qualification_notes:"<reason>"}`.

## Reporting
Counts per tier, segment distribution, persona distribution, top reasons for SKIP, and
the count advanced to `qualified`. End with the next step: `email_enrich` on `qualified`.

## Notes
- This stage runs before paid enrichment by design. If the orchestrator ever wires
  enrichment before qualify, warn (it burns credits on unqualified contacts).
- The full-data vs obfuscated-data distinction (a provider that returns linkedin_url +
  full last name vs one that returns neither) is a property of the source manifest's
  field_map — weight `data completeness` accordingly, don't hardcode provider names.
